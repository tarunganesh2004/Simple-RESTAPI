REST means representational state transfer and is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
REST is a lightweight alternative to mechanisms like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and Web Services (SOAP) etc.
RESTful applications use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

--> restful always means an HTTP-based API that is built around the principles of REST. It is a web service that follows the REST architecture.
In other words, the caller (or client):

Makes an HTTP request to a URL…
Using one of the standard HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, etc.)…
With some content (usually JSON) in the body…
And waits for a response, which:
Indicates status via an HTTP response code
And usually has more JSON in the body.

--> RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that calls can be made independently of one another, and each call contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully.

--> curl is a command-line tool that allows you to send HTTP requests from the command line. 
It is a very useful tool for debugging RESTful web services.
Ex: curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/todos
if the status code is 200, then the http request was successful. If the status code is 404, then the resource was not found.
