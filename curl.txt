curl is a command line tool that allows you to send HTTP requests from the command line. 
It is a very useful tool for debugging RESTful web services.

1) Fetch a web page:
curl http://www.google.com

2)download a file:
curl -o http://example.com/file.zip
(the -o flag tells 'curl' to save the file with the same name as on the server)

3)Send a POST request:
curl -X POST -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" http://example.com/submit
(-X flag specifies the HTTP method, -d flag specifies the data to send)

4) Send a PUT request:
curl -X PUT -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" http://example.com/submit

5) Include custom headers:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my-token" http://example.com/api/data
(-H flag allows you to include custom headers in the request)

6) Verbose output:
curl -v http://www.google.com
(-v flag enables verbose output, which shows the request and response headers)
(verbose refers to a mode or option that provides detailed information about what the tool is doing)
